This project analyzes the effectiveness of a new landing page design for a fictional newsletter service (E-News Express) using A/B testing and statistical inference.

## 🧪 Objective

To determine whether the new landing page leads to a statistically significant increase in newsletter subscriptions compared to the old version.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Scipy)
- Jupyter Notebook / HTML Export
- Statistical Testing: Z-test, Hypothesis Testing, Confidence Intervals

## 📈 Key Analysis

- Performed data cleaning and summary statistics
- Conducted a two-proportion z-test on control vs. treatment groups
- Computed confidence intervals to assess effect size
- Visualized key metrics for interpretability

## 🧠 Results

- P-value = 0.19 → No statistically significant difference observed between the old and new landing page designs.
